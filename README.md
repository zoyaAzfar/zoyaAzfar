- Hi, I’m @zoyaAzfar!
- I’m interested in HTML+CSS and in general front-end development. I also like ProcessingJS, where I've made a few games.
- I’m currently learning CSS, and JS, but will hopefully also do Python to make better games.
- In my spare time I like drawing, chess, music and reading fiction!
